What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initialising created meta data about the folder, like how many untracked files are present and all


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area acts like a bridge between working directory and the repository.......It customizes the part of the commit we need to make like just adding some files to commit and not all in the repository
