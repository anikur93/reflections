When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to share the work with other colleagues. 


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Automatically staying up-to-date may not always be good. There may be some changes which we don't need in the local, so manually doing would be better


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks : When you copy a githib repository onto ur github repository
Clones : When you copy a github repositry onto ur local
Branches : When u want make experiments and changes to the existing code but don't want to mess with the code.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The main benefit would be if we don't have the internet access, to campare the updated local files with the github file is possible ghrough locally stored remote file


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Without Git/Github means for collaborating we need to use mails or drive to send a file/code and there would not be any history or logs of the commit which makes everything difficult
