When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to share the work with other colleagues. 


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Automatically staying up-to-date may not always be good. There may be some changes which we don't need in the local, so manually doing would be better
